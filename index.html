            <strong>Distinctive categories of ai:</strong> <br />
            <span>Reactive Machines: </span>These are the most basic types of AI
            that respond to current scenarios and react on it as per possible
            best action. Such AI systems do not store memories or past
            experiences for future action. IBMs Deep Blue system is an example
            of reactive machines. <br /><span>Limited Memory:</span>These AI
            systems can store past experiences or some data for a short period
            of time. These machines can use stored data for a limited time
            period only. Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of
            Limited Memory systems1. <br /><span>Theory of Mind:</span> This is
            a more advanced type of AI that has the ability to understand
            thoughts and emotions that affect human behavior. Theory of Mind is
            a major component of social cognition. To endow machines with
            (limited) Theory of Mind capabilities, computer scientists will need
            to work closely with psychiatrists, psychologists, and
            neuroscientists.<br />
            <span>Self-awareness:</span> This is the final stage of AI, where AI
            systems have their own consciousness and emotions. It would mean
            that the AI can not only perform tasks and process information but
            also recognize itself as an independent entity with its unique
            identity.<br />

          <h2>3.What is BigData and 3V's of data?</h2>
          <p>
            Big Data refers to extremely large and diverse collections of
            structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data that continues to
            grow exponentially over time. These datasets are so huge and complex
            in volume, velocity, and variety, that traditional data management
            systems cannot store, process, and analyze them. Big Data is used in
            machine learning, predictive modeling, and other advanced analytics
            to solve business problems and make informed decisions. <br />
            <span>Volume:</span> This refers to the amount of data. Big data
            deals with data in large volumes that can reach unprecedented
            heights. Its estimated that 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created
            each day. <br />
            <span>Velocity:</span> This measures how fast the data is coming in.
            Some data will come in real-time, whereas others will come in fits
            and starts, sent to us in batches. <br />
            <span>Variety:</span> This refers to the different types of data.
            Data was once collected from one place and delivered in one format.
            Now, it is being presented in non-traditional forms, like video,
            text, pdf, and graphics on social media, as well as via tech such as
            wearable devices.

            4.What is Fragmented Data and explain hurdles with fragmented data.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Fragmented Data refers to the condition where data is scattered
            across various different systems and locations, such as clouds or
            on-premises. This fragmentation can prevent organizations from
            achieving full visibility and control of the data, and from
            maximizing the potential value of the data. <br />
            When data is fragmented, it can lead to several challenges: <br />
            <span>Inefficient use of computer capacity:</span> When data is
            distributed across different silos, it can cause computer capacity
            to be used inefficiently. <br />
            <span>Difficulty in maintaining regulatory compliance:</span>
            Without complete visibility into what data is being tracked, where
            its being stored, and who has access to it, organizations can face
            serious risks of being non-compliant with privacy laws and
            regulations. <br />
            <span>Decreased data quality:</span> Data fragmentation can impact
            the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, accessibility, and
            consistency of the data. <br />
            <span>Reduced operational efficiency:</span> The need to manage and
            coordinate multiple proprietary systems and user interfaces, each
            requiring specialist understanding, can compromise operational
            efficiency. <br />
            <span>Increased storage costs:</span> Keeping large volumes of data
            that are poorly or not exploited is quite costly. <br />
            <span>Increased exposure to data breaches:</span> <br />
            Fragmented data can sometimes escape data governance and security
            strategies, consequences that also increase exposure to data
            breaches. Data fragmentation is often accidental as organizations
            store more and more information to benefit the business. However,
            when teams no longer have complete visibility into their data,
            fragmentation becomes a considerable challenge. For these reasons,
            organizations are working to eliminate mass data fragmentation.
